# Calibration
R code for studying the usefulness of Data Generation (DG) and Data Generation and Grouping (DGG) algorithms paired with ENIR calibration
The accompanied neariso_1.0.tar.gz is from https://github.com/pakdaman/calibration
ENIR implementation is my own
Matlab code using the GPML package (http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/) for Gaussian process implementation
